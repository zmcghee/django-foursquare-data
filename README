This is the start of a Django app I'm working on as a hobby to collect
FourSquare user data from authenticated users. It relies on the very
useful djangofoursquare app, which you can find here:
http://github.com/gabesmed/djangofoursquare

Where it differs from djangofoursquare is that it does not
automatically hitch FourSquare users to users in your Auth install.
(If that's what you're looking for, you just want djangofoursquare.)

Like djangofoursquare, my app assumes you have a FOURSQUARE_CONSUMER_KEY
and a FOURSQUARE_CONSUMER_SECRET specified in your settings.py. You
also need to have 'foursquare' in your INSTALLED_APPS, although you do
not need to have djangofoursquare in your INSTALLED_APPS (my app
just imports the appropriate stuff).

The app is presented here in the context of a generic 'myproject,'
mostly because that's how I'm working on it. That said, I'm making
every effort to make my app as pluggable as possible once it's
ready to do ... whatever it is I decide it's going to do.
